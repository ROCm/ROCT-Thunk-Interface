### Boltzmann Thunk Library

This repository includes the user-mode API interfaces used to interact with the Boltzmann KFD driver. Currently supported agents include only the AMD/ATI Fiji family of discrete GPUs. Support for AMD/ATI Hawaii discrete GPUs was added in the 1.2.0 release.

#### ROCm Kernel Driver

The thunk is not a standalone product and requires that you have the correct KFD installed. We recommend reading the full compatibility and installation details which are available in the ROCK github:
https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCK-Radeon-Open-Compute-Kernel-Driver

#### Binaries for Ubuntu and Fedora

For deb and rpm binaries, please check the packages/ folder in the ROCK repository:
https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCK-Radeon-Open-Compute-Kernel-Driver

#### Building the Thunk

A simple make-based system is available for building thunk. The following are the supported targets:

```bash
    make
    make deb
    make rpm
    make clean
```

##### Note regarding libhsakmt compatibility
Please note that the libhsakmt library in this project
(ROCT-Thunk-Interface) is NOT compatible with amdkfd that is
distributed as part of the mainline Linux kernel from 3.19 and onward.
